# SCalc
SCalc is a HTML5 calculator app. The "S" stands for special, because the program goes beyond most other calculators, offering functions that most others don't offer.

NOTE: I am aware of the error where a poynomial is evaluated by only the digits to the left and right of the caret ("^"). I am currently looking into a solution.
